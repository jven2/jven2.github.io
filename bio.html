At the age of 3, I began attending kindergarten at the University School of Milwaukee, a k-12 private institution that I would later graduate from.  Throughout my time there, I joined many different clubs and sports teams, including the chess club, the soccer team, and the school boy scout troop.  Upon my high school graduation, I enrolled at Tufts University, where I study Computer Science with a minor in Finance in the school of engineering.</p>
